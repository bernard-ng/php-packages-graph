# Analyzing the PHP Ecosystem Through Dependency Graphs

The PHP ecosystem, driven by Packagist and Composer, plays a crucial role in modern web development. However, understanding its structure, stability, and licensing landscape remains a challenge. This research aims to construct a graph database representing the dependency relationships between Packagist packages. By analyzing this dataset, we explore key aspects such as dependency centrality, software stability, license distribution, and maintenance trends. Using graph-based analytics, we identify highly influential packages, detect potential dependency bottlenecks, and evaluate the long-term sustainability of PHP libraries. This study provides valuable insights for developers, maintainers, and organizations relying on PHPâ€™s open-source ecosystem.
